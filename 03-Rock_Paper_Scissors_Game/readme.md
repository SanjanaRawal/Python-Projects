# Rock Paper Scissors
A simple command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game built in Python where you play against the computer.

## Description
This is a beginner-friendly Python project that simulates the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.  
The computer makes random choices, and the game keeps score until the user decides to quit.

## How It Works
* The player is prompted to input one of three choices: rock, paper, or scissor.  The computer randomly selects its own choice.
* The game compares the inputs and determines the winner.
* Scores are tracked for both the player and the computer.
* The game continues until the player enters no when asked to play again.
